# Enhancing Productivity and Efficiency at Thavam Motors

## Project Summary

### Problem Identification

During a field visit to Thavam Motors, several critical issues were identified that hinder the productivity and efficiency of their production line:

1. **Lack of Productivity:**
   - Excessive material wastage during the cleaning of sand-casted motor casings, pumps, and other equipment.

2. **Workplace Design Issues:**
   - **Poor Layout Plan:** Inefficient layout causing delays due to excessive shifting time.
   - **Poor Lighting:** Inadequate lighting that does not comply with IESNA standards, impacting work quality.

3. **Worker Performance:**
   - Substandard processing times observed among some workers, affecting overall productivity.

4. **High Scrap Cost:**
   - Significant costs incurred due to damage during the cleaning and polishing of casted parts.

5. **Process Delays:**
   - Limited casting schedule (only two days per week) and a single CNC machine lead to delays despite having multiple workstations.

### Aim and Objectives

The aim of this project is to analyze and identify opportunities to improve the performance and efficiency of Thavam Motors through the application of industrial engineering principles. The specific objectives are:

1. **Implement Quality Control:**
   - Introduce quality control measures to enhance production standards.

2. **Develop a New Layout Plan:**
   - Design and implement a new layout plan to improve workflow efficiency and reduce shifting time.

3. **Upgrade Lighting Fixtures:**
   - Audit and upgrade lighting fixtures to meet IESNA standards, improving work quality and comfort.

4. **Implement Performance Tracking:**
   - Establish systems to monitor and improve individual worker productivity.

5. **Optimize Scheduling:**
   - Use plant simulation techniques to optimize scheduling and maximize the utilization of the CNC machine.

By addressing these issues and achieving these objectives, the project aims to significantly enhance the productivity and efficiency of Thavam Motors, reducing material wastage, improving workflow, and ensuring higher quality output.
